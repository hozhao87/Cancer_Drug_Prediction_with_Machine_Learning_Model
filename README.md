# Cancer_Drug_Prediction
 A machine learning and deep learning project for RNA seq data anaysis and drug response prediction
 Data was refered to datasets accompanies the ENLIGHT article listed below[1], RNA-seq data from different files are merged and name of geens have been fetched to the  NCBI Gene database, patients responses to drug are matched.
